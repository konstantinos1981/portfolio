            <p>
              My journey with coding began at the age of 41, a time when many
              might hesitate to start something new. But for me, it was a moment
              of clarity‚Äîa realization that had been waiting to surface for
              years. I had always been fascinated by technology, drawn to the
              endless possibilities it offered. However, it wasn‚Äôt until 2022
              that everything truly clicked into place.
            </p>
            <p>
              That year marked a turning point. The first release of ChatGPT had
              just become a reality, and suddenly, the world was abuzz with
              conversations about Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial
              Intelligence (AI). Companies across the globe were racing to
              integrate AI into their products, revolutionizing industries at an
              unprecedented pace. It was no longer just the future‚Äîit was
              happening right before our eyes.
            </p>
            <p>And I saw my opportunity.</p>
            <p>
              This was the moment to dive in, to embrace the journey, and to
              equip myself with the skills to be part of this technological
              revolution. Learning to code was no longer just an interest; it
              became a mission.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward three years, and here we are. The path has been
              challenging yet exhilarating, filled with countless late nights,
              problem-solving puzzles, and moments of breakthrough. As you
              explore my portfolio, you‚Äôll see the projects that have defined
              this journey‚Äîeach one a testament to persistence, learning, and a
              passion for building with technology.
            </p>
            <p>This is only the beginning.</p>

              enhance the user experience.

            <li>
              <strong>Typography & Color Scheme:</strong> Carefully selected
              fonts and a harmonious color palette ensure that the design is
